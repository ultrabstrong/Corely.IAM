<p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how Corely IAM ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects
    your information when you use our identity and access management platform (the "Service").
</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">1. Information We Collect</h4>

    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Log data including IP addresses, browser type, pages visited, and timestamps of access for security and operational purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mt-4">2. How We Use Your Information</h4>
<p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
<ul>

    or advertising cookies.
</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">4. Data Security</h4>
<p>
    We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information, including:

    <li>Role-based access controls on all administrative functions.</li>

<h4 class="mt-4">5. Data Retention</h4>
<p>
    We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service.
